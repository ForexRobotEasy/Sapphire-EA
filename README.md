# Sapphire EA

Sapphire EA is an expert advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This EA is designed to analyze market conditions and generate trading signals based on artificial intelligence (AI) analysis. It aims to provide automated trading solutions for the XAU/USD (Gold/US Dollar) currency pair.

## Functionality

The Sapphire EA utilizes AI analysis to generate trading signals. The AI model blends past results with new inputs to produce accurate signals. The AI analysis logic is implemented in the `AIAnalysis()` function. Currently, the sample logic generates a random trading signal.

The EA follows a risk management strategy by defining maximum risk percentage per trade, stop loss percentage, and take profit percentage. These constants can be adjusted by modifying the respective variables: `MAX_RISK_PERCENT`, `STOP_LOSS_PERCENT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_PERCENT`.

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the EA. It retrieves the account balance and calculates the lot size based on the account balance and risk percentage. It also sets the stop loss and take profit levels for all open positions.

The `Trade()` function is the main trading function. It calls the `AIAnalysis()` function to generate a trading signal. If a buy signal is generated, a buy order is executed using the `OrderSend()` function. Similarly, if a sell signal is generated, a sell order is executed.

The `OnTick()` function is the tick event function. It is called on each tick and calls the `Trade()` function to perform trading operations.

The `OnDeinit()` function is the deinitialization function. It is called when the EA is removed from the chart. It closes all open positions.
